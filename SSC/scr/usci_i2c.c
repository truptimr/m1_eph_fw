/*!     USCI I2C Code
*
*       This code is designed for I2C blocks on the MSP430 using an USCI hardware module.
* 
*       The code was desigmed on MSP430 that do not have the UCB0IV, Interrupt Vector, registers for the I2C module. It also was designed for
*       USCI blocks that have a single I2c Own Address register. Newer MSP430s exist will multiple I2C Own Addresses with individual interrupt
*       vectors for each.
* 
*       The code is specifically written to use UCB0 I2C functions the user can indicate the location of the I2C pins in Setup_I2C()
*       The code only supports Master communications (Reads and Writes). There is no support currently present in this software for Slave or
*       Multi-Master systems.
* 
*       Standard functions that will be used by implementors are:
*          Setup_I2C() - This function is called once to configure the I2C hardware
*          Write_I2C() - This function will perform an I2C write to the I2c address indicated, sending the bytes provided
*          Read_I2C()  - This function will perform a dummy I2C write of 1 byte, followed by a RESTART and
*                                     then read the number of bytes indicated into the buffer provided
*          Read_I2C_With_Stop() - This function is the same as Read_I2C, except that a STOP/START occurs between the dummy write and read,
*                                     rather than a RESTART
* 
*       Note that the Read_I2C() is specifically written to support a 1 byte dummy write. This is intended for a register offset. For I2C devices
*       that use a 2 byte register offset (or any other different dummy write), changes would be needed to the code to support it.
* 
*       The software is written to place the CPU into CPUOFF mode when executing the I2C functionality. All processing occurs in I2C interrupts.
*       At completion of an I2C functionality, the processor will exit CPUOFF mode to continue processing.
* 
*       The i2c_ISR() function is included which must be tied to the USCIAB0TX_VECTOR interrupt vector. Since this interrupt can be shared with
*       other (UART) USCI blocks, the implementation is left to a higher level program (often main.c). The i2c_ISR() function will return an
*       indicator that the processor should exit low power mode upon exit of the interrupt code.
* 
*               if (i2c_ISR())
*                   __bic_SR_register_on_exit(CPUOFF);      // Exit LPM0
* 
*       Error recovery processing is not implemented in this software. The Write_I2C(), and Read_I2C*() functions will return an error if the I2C
*       bus is already in use or a NAK is received. (I2C_FAIL_NACK)
* 
*       April 2013
*
*       \note that the functions in this file are not re-entrant. It is the user's responsibility to assure that these functions
*       are not called until the previous function has completed.
